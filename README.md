Code Overview
Hospital Management System (HMS) is designed to manage hospital operations such as handling patient and doctor data and managing appointments. The system is built using Java for the application logic and MySQL for data storage.

Key Components:
Database (MySQL):
The hospital database includes tables for patients, doctors, and appointments.
Each table stores relevant information, such as names, specializations for doctors, and appointment dates.
Java Application:
The Java application uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with the MySQL database.
It provides a text-based user interface via the console for users to interact with the system.
Primary Classes:
HMS Class:
Contains the main method and the main program loop.
Handles menu presentation and user input.
Manages connections to the MySQL database and executes high-level functions like adding patients or booking appointments.
Patient Class:
Manages patient data.
Functions include adding new patients to the database and retrieving patient details.
Doctor Class:
Manages doctor data.
Functions include adding new doctors (assumed but not shown in provided code) and retrieving doctor details.
Appointment Handling:
Managed through the HMS class.
Includes checking doctor availability and booking appointments.
Functionality:
Adding Patients/Doctors:
Users can add new patients or doctors by providing details such as name, age, gender for patients, and specialization for doctors.
The system stores these details in the respective database tables.
Viewing Patients/Doctors:
Retrieves and displays a list of all patients or doctors from the database.
Booking Appointments:
The user provides patient ID, doctor ID, and a date.
The system checks if the doctor is available on that date.
If available, the appointment is recorded in the appointments table.
Workflow:
Start the Application:
Establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
Presents a menu with options to add/view patients, add/view doctors, book appointments, and exit.
User Interaction:
Users select an option by entering a number.
Depending on the choice, the system prompts for further details (e.g., patient ID, doctor ID, appointment date).
Database Operations:
Based on user input, the system performs SQL queries to add or retrieve data.
For appointments, it checks availability first and then updates the database.
Exit the System:
Closes the database connection and terminates the application.
Error Handling:
The system catches and handles SQL and input/output exceptions, ensuring that any database or input errors do not crash the program and are logged for debugging.
Conclusion:
This HMS application is a basic yet functional example of how to integrate Java with a MySQL database to manage real-world data in a hospital setting. It demonstrates essential CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and transaction management, providing a solid foundation for further expansion, such as integrating more complex business rules or transitioning to a graphical user interface (GUI)
