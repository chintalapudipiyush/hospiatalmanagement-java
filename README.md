# Hospital Management System (HMS) Overview

## Purpose
- The HMS is designed to efficiently manage hospital operations, including handling patient and doctor data and scheduling appointments.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Implements the application logic.
- **MySQL**: Manages data storage for patients, doctors, and appointments.
- **JDBC**: Facilitates connectivity and interaction between the Java application and MySQL database.

## System Components

### Database Configuration
- Utilizes a MySQL database named `hospital`.
- Includes tables for `patients`, `doctors`, and `appointments`.
- Tables store relevant data such as patient details, doctor specializations, and scheduled appointments.

### Java Application Modules
- **HMS Class**: Serves as the entry point and controls the application flow, including user interface interactions.
- **Patient Class**: Manages operations related to patient data.
- **Doctor Class**: Handles operations concerning doctor data.

## Key Functionalities

### Manage Patients
- Add new patients to the system.
- Retrieve and display a list of all registered patients.

### Manage Doctors
- Add new doctors to the system.
- Retrieve and display a list of all available doctors.

### Manage Appointments
- Book appointments between patients and doctors.
- Check and validate doctor availability on requested dates.

## Application Workflow

### Initialization
- Connects to the MySQL database using JDBC.
- Displays a menu with various options (add/view patients, add/view doctors, book appointments, exit).

### User Interaction
- Users input their choice based on the displayed menu.
- System prompts for additional details based on selected operation.

### Database Interaction
- Executes appropriate SQL queries based on user actions.
- Updates or retrieves data from the database as needed.

### Transaction Management
- Uses transactions for operations that require data integrity, such as booking appointments.

### System Termination
- Closes database connections and exits the application upon user request.

## Error Handling and Security

### Exception Management
- Catches and handles SQL exceptions to prevent crashes.
- Manages input/output exceptions to ensure robust user interaction.

### Security Considerations
- Utilizes prepared statements to mitigate SQL injection risks.

## Conclusion
- This HMS serves as a practical example of integrating Java with a relational database to manage essential hospital operations.
- It is designed to be scalable and can be extended with additional features such as web integration or more advanced business logic.
